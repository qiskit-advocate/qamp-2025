# Week 3 — Entanglement & Bell States (Tier-1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** two “magic dice” (qubits) can be linked so their results match (or always disagree).

## What you’ll do
- Build a Bell team: **H on the first qubit → CNOT to the second → measure both**.
- See **matching results** ~50% “00” and ~50% “11”.
- Make one small change (**X on the second qubit**) and see **opposite results** ~50% “01” and ~50% “10”.
- Use a short shared bitstring to **reveal a tiny 4×4 pixel picture** with a simple “same/different” rule.

> We’re learning the concept, not the complicated math. Think coins and dice, not equations.
