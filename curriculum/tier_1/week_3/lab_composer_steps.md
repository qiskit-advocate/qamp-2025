# Lab Steps — Composer (Tier-1)

## Mini-Lab A — Matchers (|Φ⁺⟩ pattern)
1) Add 2 qubits.  
2) Put **H** on the first.  
3) Put **CNOT** from the first to the second.  
4) Measure both. Set **Shots=1024**.  
**See:** mostly **00** and **11**.

## Mini-Lab B — Opposites (|Ψ⁺⟩ pattern)
Add **X** on the second qubit before the measurements.  
**See:** mostly **01** and **10**.

## Compare
Remove **CNOT** (keep H on the first). Results look independent.

## Turn-in
Two screenshots (A and B) + 2-sentence explanation: “what I changed & why”.
