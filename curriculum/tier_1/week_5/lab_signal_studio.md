# Lab — Signal Studio (student sheet)

## A) Listen
1) Play **clean.wav** once.  
2) Play **noisy.wav** once.  
3) In one line, describe the difference using everyday words.

## B) Recipes (test both)
- **Repeat:** play **noisy.wav** twice in a row. Was it **SAME** or **DIFFERENT** from clean overall? Why?
- **Stretch:** slow the noisy clip slightly or add a short pause between halves, then play. SAME or DIFFERENT? Why?

## C) Pick your best
Circle the recipe that helped most and write **two sentences**: what changed & why that helped.

## D) Optional Composer mini
Make a *short* circuit and a *long* version (add a canceling pair like H;H). Compare bar charts.
