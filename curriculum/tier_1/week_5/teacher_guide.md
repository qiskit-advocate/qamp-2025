# Teacher Guide — Week 5: Static on the Signal

**Goal:** Students can describe “static vs. signal,” test two cleanup recipes, and explain which worked better and why.

## Flow (≈40 min)
1) Hook (2): play **clean.wav** vs **noisy.wav**. Ask, “How would you make it clearer?”
2) Try (10): teams run **Repeat** and **Stretch** (see worksheet) and mark SAME/DIFFERENT vs clean.
3) Discuss (5): which helped more? why might “longer path” hurt on real devices?
4) Optional Composer (10): build one short and one long circuit (add a canceling pair H;H or X;X). Compare bar charts.
5) Share (5): “what we changed & why.” Post best “Signal Reports.”

**Prep**
- Run: `python tools/week_5/signal_set_maker.py` (creates *signal_set/clean.wav* and *signal_set/noisy.wav* plus a worksheet stub).
- If time is tight, just play the two WAVs from your device.

**Language to use:** “static”, “clean up”, “repeat”, “stretch”, “longer path”, “compare counts”.
