# Week 5 — Static on the Signal (Tier‑1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** Sometimes our “message” gets covered by **static**. We’ll try simple recipes to make the message clearer.

## What you’ll do
- **Hear it:** compare two short sounds, *clean* vs *noisy*.
- **Try two recipes:** 
  1) **Repeat** the noisy version and compare results.  
  2) **Stretch** the time a little (longer path) and compare results.  
- **Record:** mark SAME/DIFFERENT vs the clean reference, then pick your best recipe.
- **Optional Composer moment:** make a tiny circuit both *short* and *long* (add a canceling pair like H;H or X;X) and compare counts. Longer paths can collect more “static”.

> We focus on the **concept** (signal vs. static). No heavy math—just listening and simple charts.
