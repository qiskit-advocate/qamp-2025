# Teacher Guide — Week 1 (Tier-1)

**Goal:** Students build intuition for “rest”, “mix”, and “tilt” and can explain bar charts in plain language.

## Flow (≈35–40 min)
1) Hook (2): “If I flip a coin and catch it in my palm, what could I see? Can I predict every time?”
2) Demo (5):
   - Rest: no gates → measure (Shots=200) → 100% 0.
   - Mix: add **H** → ≈50/50.
3) Explore (10): students replicate Rest + Mix, record predictions and results.
4) Tilt (10): students add small **RY** (any small angle), aim for “about 70/30”, iterate once.
5) Share (3): pairs explain “what we changed & why” (use everyday words).
6) Bridge forward (2): “Next, our **Quantum Compass** helps us point the ‘coin’ in new directions (Week 2).”

**Settings / Tips**
- Set **Shots** to 200 for quick bar charts; measure the single qubit.
- Language: “mix”, “tilt”, “mostly”, “chance”; avoid symbols/matrices.
- If **RY** isn’t visible, say “Rotation around Y” or “Tilt” in Composer’s gate list.
