# Week 1 — Qubits, Superposition & Measurement (Tier-1, Grades 6–8)

**Big idea:** A qubit can behave like a **coin** that can be at rest (always the same) or like a **coin mid-flip** (unsettled), and reading it is like **catch-and-peek**.

## What you’ll do
- **Always the same:** read a resting coin (qubit with no gates) → bar chart shows 100% “0”.
- **Quantum coin:** add **H** (think: “mix”) → bar chart shows about **50% 0 / 50% 1**.
- **Tilt the odds:** add a small **Tilt gate** (use **RY** with a small angle) → make “mostly 0” or “mostly 1”.
- **Predict → Test → Explain → Iterate:** for each change, write your guess, run, then explain the bar chart.

> We learn the **concept**, not the complicated math. We’ll use simple chances like 50/50 or 70/30.
