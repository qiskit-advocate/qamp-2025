# Lab — Composer Steps (Week 1)

## A. Resting coin (certain)
1) Add 1 qubit.  
2) **No gate** → **Measure**.  
3) Set Shots=200 → Run.  
**See:** bar chart = 100% “0”.

## B. Quantum coin (50/50)
1) Add **H** before the measure.  
2) Shots=200 → Run.  
**See:** ≈ 50% “0” and 50% “1”.

## C. Tilt the odds (≈70/30)
1) Keep **H** OR remove it (your choice).  
2) Add a small **RY** (Tilt) before the measure.  
3) Shots=200 → Run.  
**Goal:** make “mostly 0” or “mostly 1”. If it misses, adjust and try again once.

### Turn-in
- Two screenshots (B and your best C) + 2 sentences: “what I changed & why.”
