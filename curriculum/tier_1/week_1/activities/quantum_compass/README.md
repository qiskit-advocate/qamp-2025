# Quantum Compass (2D idea for Week 1)

Think of a **compass** with **Up/Down**.  
- **Mix (H):** puts the needle in the middle → 50/50 chance.  
- **Tilt (RY small):** nudges the needle toward Up or Down → change the chance.

*This simple compass picture sets us up for Week 2 where we explore more directions.*
