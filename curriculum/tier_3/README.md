# **💻 tier_3 Folder: Qiskit Developer Focus (Undergraduate/Developer)**

This folder contains all curriculum materials designed for Tier 3, targeting users with an existing background in programming and linear algebra (e.g., undergraduate students, software developers).
This tier is dedicated to mastering the formalism, notation, and tools required to build and execute quantum programs using Qiskit.

**🎯 Guiding Philosophy:**
>The focus here is rigorous definition and hands-on implementation. Students must learn to read, write, and manipulate quantum states and operations using the tools of the trade.

**Certification Alignment Goal:**
>The content's level of rigor, complexity of topics, and focus on practical implementation are specifically designed to fully prepare the user to pass the Qiskit Developer Certification and confidently engage in Qiskit-based software development.

**Goal:** 
>Move beyond visualization (Tier 2) to Dirac Notation ($|\psi\rangle$), Unitary Matrices, and Qiskit Primitives (like the Estimator).

**Key Topics:**
>Lessons covers the Formal State Vector and Born Rule (Week 1), Unitary Evolution, Density Matrix modeling of simple noise channels, and the formal structure of algorithms like VQE/QAOA.

**Source Reference:**
>All planning aligns with the "Tier 3 (Undergrad) Qiskit Developer Focus" column in the master Tiers Focus - Tiers Based Check List (found in docs/technical/).

***Contribution Guidelines:***
>**Mandatory Notation:**
>
>All materials uses Dirac Notation ($|\psi\rangle$, $\langle\psi|$, $\langle\phi|\psi\rangle$).
>
>**Focus on Qiskit Primitives:**
>
>Lessons should emphasize modern Qiskit development using primitives (Estimator, Sampler) over legacy methods.
>
>**Linear Algebra is Assumed:**
>
>Content can rely on the user having a basic understanding of vector spaces and matrix multiplication to explain unitary evolution and gate operation.
