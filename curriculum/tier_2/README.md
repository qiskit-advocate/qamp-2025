# **📐 tier2 Folder: Intermediate Math & Visuals (Grade 9-11 Focus)**

This folder contains all curriculum materials designed for Tier 2, targeting students typically in Grades 9-11. 
This tier acts as the bridge, introducing the basic mathematical tools and visualizations necessary to move beyond conceptual analogies.

**🎯 Guiding Philosophy:**
>The focus in Tier 2 is introducing the language of quantum mechanics through math and graphics, directly linking the concepts learned in Tier 1 to quantitative representations.

**Goal:** 
>Students should learn to map physical quantum concepts to simple mathematical structures (like vectors) and visual tools (like the Bloch Sphere).

**Key Topics:**
>Lessons must cover the basics of State Vectors ($\alpha$ and $\beta$ amplitudes), simple probability calculations, and the Bloch Sphere Mapping of single-qubit rotations.

**Source Reference:**
>All planning must align with the "Tier 2 (Grade 9-11) Interm. Math & Visuals" column in the master Tiers Focus - Tiers Based Check List (found in docs/technical/).
