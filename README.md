## Project: Quantum for Everyone – From Intuition to Notation

This project aims to design an inclusive, tiered curriculum introducing quantum computing concepts using Qiskit, suitable for learners as young as grade 6 and scalable up to university students and professionals. The curriculum features hands-on labs, assessments, and multilingual support (including Roman Urdu).

### Project Structure
- `curriculum/` – Curriculum outlines and tiered content
- `labs/` – Interactive Jupyter notebooks (English & translations)
- `assessments/` – Quizzes, coding tasks, and mini-projects
- `translations/` – Templates and translated content
- `docs/` – Documentation and teaching guides
- `blog/` – Project journey and outreach posts

### Contribution Guidelines
1. Please read the curriculum vision and roadmap before contributing.
2. Use the translation template for new language versions.
3. For labs and assessments, follow the provided structure and pedagogical notes.
4. Open issues for suggestions or improvements.
5. All contributors must adhere to the Qiskit Code of Conduct.

## What is QAMP?

Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program (QAMP) is a program focused on bring new contributors into Qiskit open source software development where Qiskit advocates work on a 3-month projects under the guidance of mentors. It is an initiative designed to support growth and collaboration within our vibrant community. 

Access the QAMP information deck [here]([https://ibm.box.com/v/qamp2025_call](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/blob/main/QAMP_call.pdf)).

*Mentees* can expect to learn how to contribute to quantum computing advancement. Participants more experienced in open-source development can hone and develop specialized skills. Mentees must be Qiskit advocates.

*Mentors* can expect to develop leadership and teamwork skills, while making a significant impact on the next generation of quantum developers and leaders.

- Demonstrate level of expertise in quantum computing and coding skills.
    - Examples: pull requests to Qiskit GitHub repos, blogpost style Qiskit tutorials, research papers.
    - If you want to increase your chance of being selected, you can fix an issue on [Qiskit GitHub repos](https://github.com/Qiskit) during the application period. A good place to start are issues with tag ["good first issues"](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Aupdated-asc+-label%3A%22status%3A+pending+PR%22).
- Submit the application form (link shared in the the Qiskit Advocate Hub on Discord and the advocate-only spaces in Qiskit Slack).

During mentoring period (> 5 hours per week)
- Discuss with your mentor to refine project details and define deliverables. (During the first 2 weeks)
- Work on a project with guidance from your mentor. You should dedicate at least 5 hours per week for a meaningful mentorship experience.
- Meet with your mentor regularly to report progress and get feedbacks. (1 hour call every week).
- Present project ideas and progress in the two checkpoints.
- Present final outcome in the final showcase

## Commitment from mentors

During mentoring period (1-3 hours per week)
- 3 month mentorship
- Propose project ideas
- Selecting mentees (estimated 2 hours to review applications)
- 30~60 min call every week or every 2 weeks
- Attend checkpoints and final showcase calls

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Who is eligible to apply?
A: Participating in QAMP as a mentee is exclusive to Qiskit advocates. You need to become a Qiskit advocate to apply for the program. Read [here](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/community#advocates) for more information about how to become a Qiskit advocate. 

Mentors do not need to be Qiskit advocates.


#### Q: How long is the mentorship program?
A: The official mentoring period is 3 months. See [here](#important-dates) for the important dates.

#### Q: How do a mentor and a mentee get matched?
A: You will be matched based on the project preference and interest areas indicated in your application form as well as the evidence you have provided to demonstrate your experience and commitment.




### For prospective mentees:

#### Q: Can mentees propose projects?
A: Yes! Mentees can propose project ideas by submitting them as a github issue [here](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/issues) during the application period. If a mentor is interested in your project, you will be matched to work on the project.

#### Q: I don't have much programming experience, can I still apply?
A: Yes! The mentorship program is meant for developing your skills. Some projects require only minimal programming experience. You will be able to learn and improve your programming skills with guidance of your mentor. Some projects focus on supporting individuals to make their first PR to Qiskit or the Qiskit ecosystem. You may also apply to a project that is less focused on code (e.g., tutorial or blog writing).

#### Q: What can I expect to gain out of being a QAMP mentee?
- Networking
- Improved skills in project topics
- Published papers or other deliverables 
- Professional development experience

#### Q: What is the expected time commitment?
Time commitment varies across projects and is noted on each project issue. However, we expect QAMP to require approximately 4-8 hours of your time per week.

#### Q: Is this program worth my time?
In previous QAMP surveys, 90% of responding mentees agreed or strongly agreed that the program improved their quantum skills.​

### For prospective mentors:

#### Q:  What can I expect to gain out of being a QAMP mentor?
- Opportunity to share your knowledge and develop leadership skills
- Learn through teaching
- Opportunity to shape the Qiskit community and future leaders in quantum computing

#### Q:  What is the role of a mentor?
- Help mentees understand core concepts and techniques
- Provide mentees with feedback
- Help mentees find relevant learning/research materials
- Project and people management

#### Q:  What is the expected time commitment?
Being a mentor takes approximately 1-3 hours per week for the duration of the program, plus a couple of hours for the mentee matching process. During the program, you should meet with your mentees at a mutually agreed-upon frequency (usually weekly).

#### Q:  Is this program worth my time?
In previous QAMP surveys, 88% of responding mentors agreed or strongly agreed that the program was a worthwhile use of their time.​

#### Q: Do I need to be a Qiskit advocate to be a QAMP mentor?
No. 

#### Q: By when should I propose a project? 
Asap. Prospective mentee applications will be sent to you on a rolling basis from mid-September onwards. Proposal submissions close on 30 Sept.
